# Accessibility on SEO Webpages

## Description
I've created this project to enhance the accessibility of a webpage. It's important that users of assistive technology be able to navigate a site and have an experience that results in expected outcomes. The project contains new alt text for images and corrected HTML order like headers, that will align to accessibility standards.

## Installation
To execute this project I used VS code and Windows CLI. I referred to the source code provided in the assignment module and by downloading it to my local machine and adding the files to my local repo before pushing it to github. There were no other tools that I used.

## Usage 
Using alt text and the correct heading structure allows assistive technology to correctly scan and interpret the page for the user. 

## Credits
While I worked solo in making the changes to the webpage for accessibility, I read through stack overflow to understand how to add alt text to a background image that was in the CSS file. I'm still learning how to do this but I arrived at a middle ground to add the alt text to the hero (line 27) so that a screen reader would pick up on the text about a background image. I didn't follow their guidance but as I learn more I'll see how their recommended approach works.
